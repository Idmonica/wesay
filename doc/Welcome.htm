<H1>Welcome to WeSay <FONT COLOR="#c0504d">1.6 Beta Release 1</FONT></H1>
<HR>

<p class="MsoNormal">You have installed a <em>beta version</em> of WeSay.&#160; New features appear in the beta versions, but new bugs might appear too! Let us know of any problems.</p>

<h1 class="Section1">About this version</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal">WeSay comes in two flavors: 'stable' and 'beta'.&#160;&#160; Once a version is 'stable", it will only receive critical bug fixes, but not new features or anything risky.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If crashes or other bugs would be a major problem for you, please uninstall this version and get our most recent <a href="http://wesay.org/downloads">stable one</a> (one without the 'beta' tag).&#160; If you are helping us advance WeSay, are evaluating WeSay's capabilities, or are just willing to risk the occasional bug, this is the version for you.&#160; This is where we are currently adding new abilities in response to your requests, and we need people to help ensure that it can become stable, too.
  If you report a bug via <a href="mailto:issues@wesay.org">issues@wesay.org</a>, we can oftentimes fix it and provide a new release within hours.&#160; So let us know if you're in a hurry for a fix.</p>

<h1 class="Section1">What's New in 1.6?</h1>
<p>Version 1.6 provides a new feature to choose either <em>Definition</em>(default) or <em>Gloss</em> as the Meaning field. You can find the option in the WeSay Configuration tool in the configration of the Dictionary Browse and Edit task. Gloss is the preferred choice when sharing data with FLEx.</p>
<p>If you change the option it will not change existing data in WeSay. You can use the Bulk Edit feature of FLEx to copy or move data between Definition and Gloss.</p>

<h3>Common improvements</h3>
<p>Upgraded Chorus to the same version that is used by FLEx 8.3.9 which should improve Send/Receive</p>

<h3>Known issues in the beta on Windows</h3>
<p>Sound input systems do not work on some computers.</p>
<p>Spell checking will only work if you install <a href="http://downloads.sil.org/legacy/wesay/Enchant.1.4.2.1.msi">Enchant</a>. In the future we hope to add this to the WeSay installer.

<h1>Ready to go deeper?</h1>

<p>Consider joining the <a href="https://community.software.sil.org/c/wesay">WeSay Language Software Community</a> site. &#160; Until we have real documentation, this is the place to go when something is unclear.&#160; As you ask questions, we'll answer them there.&#160; You can read old questions and answers there. </p>

<p>Please report bugs or request a feature using <a href="mailto:issues@wesay.org">email</a>. Tell us that you tried it and what you did.&#160; No, really.&#160; It's human nature to assume someone else had the same crash, but if it was easy to run into, we would have found it, and we would have fixed it.&#160;&#160;&#160; When you send to this address, your issue is automatically entered into our &quot;todo list&quot; and you will get updates as we work on the problem.</p>

<p>We are adding to WeSay's abilities regularly, and publishing new versions <a href="http://software.sil.org/wesay/download/" target="_blank">here</a>.&#160; Major new features are always announced on <a href="https://software.sil.org/wesay/news/">the WeSay news.</a></p>
