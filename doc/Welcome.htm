<h1 class="Section1">About this version</h1>

<h1 class="Section1">What's New in 1.3?</h1>

<h3>Display glosses in Gather by Semantic Domain Task</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you configure this task so that users can enter a gloss (in addition to the vernacular word), the gloss will now show up, in grey, under the word in the list.  An advisor requested this as it helps him see what is being gathered.</p>

<h3>New Image Toolbox</h3>
<h4>Importing and Image</h4>
	<p class="MsoNormal">Previously, WeSay supported selecting images from the Art Of
		Reading collection via search (starting, automatically, by looking for pictures that match the gloss).  Now when you click to add an image,&nbsp;
		the Image Toolbox opens, and lets you:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				Scan in a drawing</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				Get a picture from your camera</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				Choose an image from Art of Reading
				(as before)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p class="MsoNormal">
				Choose a file from your file system (as before)</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>
		Intellectual Property</h4>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
		For any of these images, WeSay now can read and write metadata about the image:
		the illustrator, copyright, and license. For the license, you can answer a
		few questions and WeSay will select a nice Creative Commons license to match your wishes.&nbsp;This meta data will be invisibly embedded in the image itself, so that this
		information will be readable now and in the future by other tools which
		understand image metadata.</p>
	<h4>
		Cropping</h4>
	<p class="MsoNormal">
		The Image Toolbox has a very simple cropping tool, built-in.</p>
	<h3>
		New Art Of Reading Download</h3>
	<p>
		SIL has recently granted a Creative Commons License for
		<a href="http://bloom.palaso.org/art-of-reading/">Art Of Reading</a>, and Palaso
		has created a downloadable installer for the collection.&nbsp;Just install it,
		and suddenly Bloom and WeSay will be able to use it.&nbsp;Naturally, our
		version has all the metadata embedded: the illustrator (where known), Copyright,
		Creative Commons license, and keywords.</p>

<h3>Delete input systems</h3>

You can now delete input systems. Associated data can either be deleted as well or it can be merged into another input system.

<h3>Improved help</h3>

Hit the F1 key to get context sensitive help anywhere in WeSay. Have a question? please let us know and we will see about adding the answer to the help files!

<h3>Printing Custom Fields in "Make PDF Dictionary"</h3>
As always, we recommend using FLEx/Pathways for your final print jobs, and the "Make PDF Dictionary" for one-click drafts. Starting with this version, if you name your custom field "plural" it will now show up in the PDF dictionary. Other custom fields can now be added as well, but at this point, this can only be done by adding an entry in the "customlayout.css" stylesheet in the export folder. Check out the end of the "Autolayout.css" file to see how it was done for "plural", or ask for help if you need a custom stylesheet.

<h3>Changes in Gather by Semantic Domains</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Glosses are now displayed alongside the gathered words, in the list of words gathered for a domain.</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="Section1">What Now?</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">Get your head around WeSay' it's really different.&#160; It's aimed at empowering a very different user than you are, and approaches the task of dictionary making in a new, super-task-oriented way.&#160; Using the provided samples, play around with both WeSay and the WeSay Configuration Tool.&#160; To do this, go to your Windows Start menu and find 'WeSay'.&#160; Choose one of the icons there which open the sample project.</span></p>

<h1>Documentation</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">Currently, we keep the documentation as a separate download.&#160; You can get it and read more advanced help topics on our wiki, <a href="http://wesay.org/wiki/Help_And_Contact">here</a>.</span></p>

<h1>Ready to go deeper?</h1>

<p>Consider joining the <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/wesay">Google Group</a>. You can either use this group from your browser, through your email client, or a mix of both.&#160; Until we have real documentation, this is the place to go when something is unclear.&#160; As you ask questions, we'll answer them there.&#160; A Google Group is a mailing list, but one that you can choose to have sent to your email box or wait for you to browse on the web, your choice. You can read old questions and answers. </p>

<p>Please report a bugs or request a feature using <a href="mail://issues@wesay.org">email</a>. Tell us that you tried it and what you did.&#160; No, really.&#160; It's human nature to assume someone else had the same crash' but if it was easy to run into, we would have found it, and we would have fixed it.&#160;&#160;&#160; When you send to this address, your issue is automatically entered into our &quot;todo list&quot; and you will get updates as we work on the problem.</p>

<p>We are adding to WeSay's abilities regularly, and publishing new versions <a href="http://wesay.org/downloads" target="_blank">here</a>.&#160; Major new features are always announced on <a href="http://wesay.org/blogs">the blog.</a></p>
