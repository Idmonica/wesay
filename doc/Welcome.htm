</div>

<p class="MsoNormal">You have installed a <em>development version</em> of WeSay.&#160; This is a team effort, and <span style="color: #9bbb59">we really appreciate</span> your willingness to give WeSay a spin and send us feedback.&#160; </p>

<h1 class="Section1">About this version</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal">WeSay comes in two flavors: “stable” (even numbered ones) and “development” (odd numbered ones).&#160;&#160; The even versions receive critical bug fixes, but not new features or anything risky.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If crashes or other bugs would be a major problem for you, please uninstall this version and get our most recent <a href="http://wesay.org/downloads">0.6.xxxx one</a>.&#160; If you are helping us advance WeSay, are evaluating WeSay’s capabilities, or are just willing to risk the occasional bug, this is the version for you.&#160; This is where we are currently adding new abilities in response to your requests, and we need people to help ensure that it can become stable, too. Eventually, we will retire 0.6 and 0.7 will be relabeled “0.8 - Stable”. Note that at times we post new “odd” versions almost daily.&#160; If you report a bug via <a href="mailto:issues@wesay.org"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: &#39;Tahoma&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;; font-size: 12pt">issues@wesay.org</span></a>, we can often times fix it and provide a new release within hours.&#160; So let us know if you’re in a hurry for a fix.</p>

<h1 class="Section1">What’s New in 0.7?</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal">Here’s what we’ve added, so far, to 0.7.&#160; More improvements are planned.</p>

<h3 class="Section1">Team Collaboration using Send/Receive &amp; Chorus</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal">The plan for the 0.7 series is to enable multiple team members to work on the same dictionary.&#160; This is done using something called Chorus along with Mercurial… it will come in stages, beginning with this version, which provides teams with the bare minimum needed to synchronize their work using USB keys, office networks, or a server on the internet. To use these features, you must download and install either <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/BinaryPackages">Mercurial</a> or <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=199155">TortoiseHg</a> onto each machine which will participate.</p>

<h2>What Now?</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">Get your head around WeSay… it’s really different.&#160; It’s aimed at empowering a very different user than you are, and approaches the task of dictionary making in a new, super-task-oriented way.&#160; Using the provided samples, play around with both WeSay and the WeSay Configuration Tool.&#160; To do this, go to your Windows Start menu and find “WeSay”.&#160; Choose one of the icons there which open the sample project.</span></p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">Currently, we keep the documentation as a separate download.&#160; You can get it and read more advanced help topics on our wiki, <a href="http://wesay.org/wiki/Help_And_Contact">here</a>.</span></p>

<h3>Ready to go deeper?</h3>

<p>Consider joining the <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/wesay">Google Group</a>. You can either use this group from your browser, through your email client, or a mix of both.&#160; Until we have real documentation, this is the place to go when something is unclear.&#160; As you ask questions, we’ll answer them there.&#160; A Google Group is a mailing list, but one that you can choose to have sent to your email box or wait for you to browse on the web, your choice. You can read old questions and answers. </p>

<p>Please report a bugs or request a feature using <a href="mail://issues@wesay.org">email</a>. Tell us that you tried it and what you did.&#160; No, really.&#160; It’s human nature to assume someone else had the same crash… but if it was easy to run into, we would have found it, and we would have fixed it.&#160;&#160;&#160; When you send to this address, your issue is automatically entered into our &quot;todo list&quot; and you will get updates as we work on the problem.</p>

<p>We are adding to WeSay's abilities weekly, and publishing new versions.&#160; Major new features are always announced on <a href="http://blogs.wesay.org">the blog.</a></p>
