<H1>Welcome to WeSay <FONT COLOR="#c0504d">1.6.x-Alpha</FONT></H1>
<HR>

<p class="MsoNormal">You have installed an <em>alpha version</em> of WeSay.&#160; New features appear in the alpha versions, but new bugs might appear too! Let us know of any problems.</p>

<h1 class="Section1">About this version</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal">WeSay comes in two flavors: 'stable' and 'beta'.&#160;&#160; Once a version is 'stable", it will only receive critical bug fixes, but not new features or anything risky.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If crashes or other bugs would be a major problem for you, please uninstall this version and get our most recent <a href="http://wesay.org/downloads">stable one</a> (one without the 'beta' tag).&#160; If you are helping us advance WeSay, are evaluating WeSay's capabilities, or are just willing to risk the occasional bug, this is the version for you.&#160; This is where we are currently adding new abilities in response to your requests, and we need people to help ensure that it can become stable, too.
	If you report a bug via <a href="mailto:issues@wesay.org">issues@wesay.org</a>, we can oftentimes fix it and provide a new release within hours.&#160; So let us know if you're in a hurry for a fix.</p>
<h1 class="section1">What's New in 1.6?</h1>
<p>Version 1.6 migrates user and project preferences from the writing system LDML (Locale Data Markup Language) file to a new SharedSettings folder that will be accessible to future versions of other lexicon tools. Once a project has been migrated in WeSay 1.6, the data will be incompatible to prior versions of WeSay.</p>
<p>It is ideal to be online when creating a new project so WeSay can download the associated LDML from the SLDR (SIL Locale Data Repository).</p>
<h1 class="Section1">What's New in 1.5?</h1>
<p>Version 1.5 mainly brings the functionality of the Windows version to the Linux platform.  However, some improvements were made in the Windows version as well.</p>

<h3>Common improvements</h3>
<p>Improved setup of keyboards in the Configuration Tool.</p>
<p>Now possible to start a new project from Chorus Hub in the Configuration Tool.</p>
<p>Fixed some display issues in Dictionary Browse &amp; Edit.</p>
<p>Many bugfixes for Send/Receive with FLEx.</p>
<p>Fix some issues with project creation.</p>

<h3>Improvements to the Windows version</h3>
<p>Installer now includes Gecko for rendering of complex scripts.  It is off by default, but can be turned on.</p>


<h3>New in the Linux version</h3>
<p>Fix rendering issues for both roman and non-roman scripts.</p>
<p>Enable use of ibus keyboards.</p>
<p>Fix many display issues (missing icons, clipped labels, etc.).</p>
<p>Fix the selection of the semantic domain.</p>
<p>Enable add-ins.</p>
<p>Export to PDF and LibreOffice.</p>
<p>Enable several features that were new since WeSay 1.1:
<ul>
<li>Audio recording and playback</li>
<li>Chorus Notes</li>
<li>Art of Reading image collection</i>
<li>Send/Receive capability</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Consider joining the <a href="http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wesay">Google Group</a>. You can either use this group from your browser, through your email client, or a mix of both.&#160; Until we have real documentation, this is the place to go when something is unclear.&#160; As you ask questions, we'll answer them there.&#160; A Google Group is a mailing list, but one that you can choose to have sent to your email box or wait for you to browse on the web, your choice. You can read old questions and answers. </p>

<p>Please report a bugs or request a feature using <a href="mailto:issues@wesay.org">email</a>. Tell us that you tried it and what you did.&#160; No, really.&#160; It's human nature to assume someone else had the same crash' but if it was easy to run into, we would have found it, and we would have fixed it.&#160;&#160;&#160; When you send to this address, your issue is automatically entered into our &quot;todo list&quot; and you will get updates as we work on the problem.</p>

<p>We are adding to WeSay's abilities regularly, and publishing new versions <a href="http://wesay.org/downloads" target="_blank">here</a>.&#160; Major new features are always announced on <a href="http://wesay.org/blogs">the blog.</a></p>
