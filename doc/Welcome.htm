</div>

<p class="MsoNormal">You have installed a test version of WeSay.&#160; This is a team effort, and <span style="color: #9bbb59">we really appreciate</span> your willingness to give WeSay a spin and send us feedback.&#160; </p>

<h1 class="Section1">About this version</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal">WeSay comes in two flavors: &#8220;stable&#8221; (even numbered ones) and &#8220;development&#8221; (odd numbered ones).&#160;&#160; The even versions receive critical bug fixes, but not new features or anything risky.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If crashes or other bugs would be a major problem for you, please uninstall this version and get our most recent &#8220;even&#8221; numbered one.&#160; If you are evaluating WeSay&#8217;s capabilities or are willing to risk the occasional bug, this is the version for you.&#160; This is where we are currently adding new abilities in response to your requests, and we need people to help ensure that it can become stable, too. Eventually, we will retire 0.4 and 0.5 will be relabeled &#8220;0.6 - Stable&#8221;. Note that at times we post new &#8220;odd&#8221; versions almost daily.&#160; If you report a bug via <a href="mailto:issues@wesay.org"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &#39;Tahoma&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;">issues@wesay.org</span></a>, we can often times fix it and provide a new release within hours.&#160; So let us know if you&#8217;re in a hurry for a fix.</p>

<h1 class="Section1">What&#8217;s New in 0.5?</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal">Here&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve added, so far, to 0.5.&#160; More improvements are planned.</p>

<h3 class="Section1">Enter Example Translations in Add Missing Example Sentences Task</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the &#8220;Add Missing Example Sentences&#8221; task, You can now enable a place for immediately collecting a translation of the example.&#160; (This was always possible in the Browse &amp; Edit view, of course). </p>

<h3 class="Section1">Add translation in Gather By Semantic Domain Task</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal">You can now turn on an option to show a &#8220;meaning&#8221; field in the Gather By Semantic Domains task.&#160;&#160; Be warned, this has some problematic aspects.&#160; For example, if you later click on a word you previously entered, and change its spelling, you will now get a new word, and the old spelling will remain.&#160; Some of this may seem like a &#8220;bug&#8221; to a human, but it&#8217;s hard for the program to safely guess what the right thing is to do, and the &#8220;WeSay way&#8221; is to avoid asking the user questions.&#160; We welcome your ideas on this. In the meantime, we leave it to you to decide if the benefits outweigh the problems.</p>

<h3 class="Section1">Semantic Domain Numbers</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal">By popular demand, numbers have returned, everywhere we show Semantic Domain labels.&#160; This is a good time to note that if you want to add semantic domains in the Browse &amp; Edit view, you can do that by typing in the number of the domain, or search for an applicable domain by typing in relevant words.</p>

<h3 class="Section1">Linux</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">We&#8217;ve got WeSay running on Ubuntu Linux, so if you would like to help us test that version too, let us know.</span>&#160; We even have SD chips which boot an OLPC XO into Ubuntu so you can run WeSay in indestructible 5 watt bliss.&#160; Some features are as yet unavailable on Linux, including USB-stick backup,&#160; email, audio features, and pdf dictionary making.</p>

<h3 class="Section1">Peace of Mind</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal">An important new thing we&#8217;re adding in 0.5 is automated incremental backup.&#160; The way this works is that you put some kind of memory stick into the laptop (like the memory your digital camera uses), then tell WeSay where to find it.&#160; You just leave that memory chip in, permanently.&#160; WeSay will silently keep changes there, in a way that you can always &#8220;roll-back&#8221; if things go very wrong.&#160; This is the first feature that uses the Chorus collaboration component SIL is building.&#160; To enable this and forthcoming <a href="http://projects.palaso.org/chorus">Chorus</a> features, you need to install a package called &#8220;Mercurial&#8221;. On Windows, download and install <a href="http://tortoisehg.sourceforge.net/">TortoiseHG</a>.</p>

<h3>One click to Create PDF Dictionary</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">A PDF dictionary is now a mouse-click away, once you install <a href="http://princexml.com">princexml</a>.&#160; (This feature is Windows only, temporarily). Please, &gt;let us know if you use this feature.</span> </p>

<h3 class="Section1">Open With Lexique Pro</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">If you need more some more than the basics, WeSay now provides a button for opening your dictionary in <a href="http://lexiquepro.com/test.htm">Lexique Pro (version 3)</a> (Windows only).&#160; </span>See <a href="http://www.wesay.org/blogs/2009/01/07/single-click-printing/">the blog</a> for details. </p>

<h3>Audio Recording and Playback</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">You can now add audio recording and playback to any text field.&#160; Simply create a new writing system, and mark it &#8220;Audio&#8221;.&#160; Then tick this writing system for any fields (e.g. Word or Example) where you want to enable users to speak the text, as well as write it.&#160; Audio files are created in the new &#8220;audio&#8221; folder of the WeSay project.&#160; (Temporarily Windows only). See <a href="http://www.wesay.org/blogs/2009/01/07/collecting-audio-with-wesay/">the blog</a> for details.&#160; Please, let us know if you use this feature.</span></p>

<h3>Where was I?</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">WeSay now remembers where you were in the dictionary browse &amp; edit.&#160; It also remembers any adjustments you made to change the size of parts of the screen.</span></p>

<h3>Art of Reading Integration</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">Now WeSay will use definitions to search SIL's Art Of Reading clipart library, if you have that CD in the drive or have copied the contents to C:\ (on windows).&#160; A box opens up with images that might fit the entry.&#160; If you choose one, it is copied to the dictionary project and inserted in the entry.&#160; See <a href="http://www.wesay.org/blogs/2009/04/08/art-of-reading-comes-to-wesay/">the blog</a> for details.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">Faster</span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">We're always looking for ways to make WeSay fast even on small, inexpensive computers.&#160; Recent 0.5 builds are our fastest ever.</span></p>

<h3>Save for FieldWorks 5.4</h3>
<p>The LIFT xml format which WeSay uses continues to improve.  This version of WeSay now conforms to version 0.13 of the standard, as does the forthcoming FLEx 6.0.  However, since FLEx 6.0 won't be publically avialable for several months, this raises the problem for people wishing to load WeSay data into FieldWorks Language
Explorer 5.4.  That version of FLEx will tell you that it doesn't know how to read LIFT version 0.13. We've added a command, found on the toolbar in the WeSay Configuration Tool, to "Save a copy for FLEx 5.4".</p>

<h2>What Now?</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">Get your head around WeSay&#8230; it&#8217;s really different.&#160; It&#8217;s aimed at empowering a very different user than you are, and approaches the task of dictionary making in a new, super-task-oriented way.&#160; Using the provided samples, play around with both WeSay and the WeSay Configuration Tool.&#160; To do this, go to your Windows Start menu and find &#8220;WeSay&#8221;.&#160; Choose one of the icons there which open the sample project.</span></p>

<h3>Ready to go deeper?</h3>

<p>Consider joining the <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/wesay">Google Group</a>. You can either use this group from your browser, through your email client, or a mix of both.&#160; Until we have real documentation, this is the place to go when something is unclear.&#160; As you ask questions, we&#8217;ll answer them there.&#160; A Google Group is a mailing list, but one that you can choose to have sent to your email box or wait for you to browse on the web, your choice. You can read old questions and answers. </p>

<p>Please report a bugs or request a feature using <a href="mail://issues@wesay.org">email</a>. Tell us that you tried it and what you did.&#160; No, really.&#160; It&#8217;s human nature to assume someone else had the same crash&#8230; but if it was easy to run into, we would have found it, and we would have fixed it.&#160;&#160;&#160; When you send to this address, your issue is automatically entered into our &quot;todo list&quot; and you will get updates as we work on the problem.</p>

<p>We are adding to WeSay's abilities weekly, and publishing new versions.&#160; Major new features are always announced on <a href="http://blogs.wesay.org">the blog.</a></p>
