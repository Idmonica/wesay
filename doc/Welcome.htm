<H1>Welcome to WeSay <FONT COLOR="#c0504d">1.9.x-Alpha</FONT></H1>
<HR>

<p class="MsoNormal">You have installed an <em>alpha version</em> of WeSay.&#160; New features appear in the alpha versions, but new bugs might appear too! Let us know of any problems.</p>

<h1 class="Section1">About this version</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal">WeSay comes in two flavors: 'stable' and 'alpha/beta'.&#160;&#160; Once a version is 'stable", it will only receive critical bug fixes, but not new features or anything risky.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If crashes or other bugs would be a major problem for you, please uninstall this version and get our most recent <a href="http://wesay.org/downloads">stable one</a> (one without the 'beta' tag).&#160; If you are helping us advance WeSay, are evaluating WeSay's capabilities, or are just willing to risk the occasional bug, this is the version for you.&#160; This is where we are currently adding new abilities in response to your requests, and we need people to help ensure that it can become stable, too.
	If you report a bug via <a href="mailto:issues@wesay.org">issues@wesay.org</a>, we can oftentimes fix it and provide a new release within hours.&#160; So let us know if you're in a hurry for a fix.</p>
<h1 class="section1">What's New in 1.9?</h1>
<p>Version 2.0 is a synchronized release with <a href="http://fieldworks.sil.org/download/">FieldWorks</a> which migrates user and project preferences from the writing system LDML (Locale Data Markup Language) file to a new SharedSettings folder.  Common writing systems between the two tools will be able to share font and keyboard selections.  Note: this migration is not backwards-compatible with prior versions of WeSay.  Ensure the rest of the collaborators on your team that send/receive the project also upgrade to the same versions.</p>
<p>It is recommended to be online when creating a new project so WeSay can download the associated LDML from the SLDR (SIL Locale Data Repository).</p>
<h3>Common improvements</h3>
<p>WS-287 Fixed importing pictures from Lift projects</p>
<p>WS-328 Fixed font selection when making a Simple Pdf Dictionary</p>
<p>WS-321 Made Semantic Domains tab robust when handling Audio writing systems</p>
<p>Upgraded Chorus to the same version that is used by Fieldworks 9 which should improve Send/Receive</p>
<h3>Known issues in the alpha on Windows</h3>
<p>Sound input systems do not work on some computers.</p>
<p>Spell checking will only work if you install <a href="http://downloads.sil.org/legacy/wesay/Enchant.1.4.2.1.msi">Enchant</a>. In the future we hope to add this to the WeSay installer.

<p>If crashes or other bugs would be a major problem for you, please uninstall this version and get our most recent <a href="http://wesay.org/downloads">stable one</a> (one without the 'alpha' or 'beta' tag).&#160; If you are helping us advance WeSay, are evaluating WeSay's capabilities, or are just willing to risk the occasional bug, this is the version for you.&#160; This is where we are currently adding new abilities in response to your requests, and we need people to help ensure that it can become stable, too.
  If you report a bug via <a href="mailto:issues@wesay.org">issues@wesay.org</a>, we can oftentimes fix it and provide a new release within hours.&#160; So let us know if you're in a hurry for a fix.</p>


<h2>Ready to go deeper?</h2>

<p>Consider joining the <a href="https://community.software.sil.org/c/wesay">WeSay Language Software Community</a> site. &#160; Until we have real documentation, this is the place to go when something is unclear.&#160; As you ask questions, we'll answer them there.&#160; You can read old questions and answers there. </p>

<p>Please report bugs or request a feature using <a href="mailto:issues@wesay.org">email</a>. Tell us that you tried it and what you did.&#160; No, really.&#160; It's human nature to assume someone else had the same crash, but if it was easy to run into, we would have found it, and we would have fixed it.&#160;&#160;&#160; When you send to this address, your issue is automatically entered into our &quot;todo list&quot; and you will get updates as we work on the problem.</p>

<p>We are adding to WeSay's abilities regularly, and publishing new versions <a href="http://software.sil.org/wesay/download/" target="_blank">here</a>.&#160; Major new features are always announced on <a href="https://software.sil.org/wesay/news/">the WeSay news.</a></p>
