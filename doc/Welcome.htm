<H1>Welcome to WeSay <FONT COLOR="#c0504d">0.6.x-Stable</FONT></H1>
<HR>
<P>You have installed a stable version of WeSay.&nbsp; This is a team
effort, and <FONT COLOR="#9bbb59">we really appreciate</FONT> your
willingness to give WeSay a spin and send us feedback.&nbsp;
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">About this version</H2>
<P>WeSay comes in two flavors: &ldquo;stable&rdquo; (even numbered
ones) and &ldquo;development&rdquo; (odd numbered ones).&nbsp;&nbsp;
The even versions receive critical bug fixes, but not new features or
anything risky.</P>
<P STYLE="line-height: 115%">If crashes or other bugs would be a
major problem for you, then this is the release for you.&nbsp;
However, if you would like to evaluate WeSay&rsquo;s capabilities or
are willing to risk the occasional bug, then please download one of
our <A HREF="http://wesay.org/downloads">0.7.x</A> &ndash;
development versions which is where we are currently adding new
abilities in response to your requests, and we need people to help
ensure that it can become stable, too. Eventually, we will retire 0.6
and 0.7 will be relabeled &ldquo;0.8 - Stable&rdquo;. Note that at
times we post new &ldquo;odd&rdquo; versions almost daily.&nbsp; If
you report a bug via <A HREF="mailto:issues@wesay.org"><FONT FACE="Tahoma, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>issues@wesay.org</FONT></FONT></A>,
we can often times fix it and provide a new release within hours.&nbsp;
So let us know if you&rsquo;re in a hurry for a fix.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">What&rsquo;s New in 0.6?</H2>
<P>Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve added.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Enter Example Translations in Add Missing Example
Sentences Task</H3>
<P>In the &ldquo;Add Missing Example Sentences&rdquo; task, You can
now enable a place for immediately collecting a translation of the
example.&nbsp; (This was always possible in the Browse &amp; Edit
view, of course).
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Add translation in Gather By Semantic Domain Task</H3>
<P>You can now turn on an option to show a &ldquo;meaning&rdquo;
field in the Gather By Semantic Domains task.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be warned,
this has some problematic aspects.&nbsp; For example, if you later
click on a word you previously entered, and change its spelling, you
will now get a new word, and the old spelling will remain.&nbsp; Some
of this may seem like a &ldquo;bug&rdquo; to a human, but it&rsquo;s
hard for the program to safely guess what the right thing is to do,
and the &ldquo;WeSay way&rdquo; is to avoid asking the user
questions.&nbsp; We welcome your ideas on this. In the meantime, we
leave it to you to decide if the benefits outweigh the problems.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Semantic Domain Numbers</H3>
<P>By popular demand, numbers have returned, everywhere we show
Semantic Domain labels.&nbsp; This is a good time to note that if you
want to add semantic domains in the Browse &amp; Edit view, you can
do that by typing in the number of the domain, or search for an
applicable domain by typing in relevant words.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Linux</H3>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">We&rsquo;ve got WeSay running
on Ubuntu Linux, so if you would like to help us test that version
too, let us know.</SPAN>&nbsp; We even have SD chips which boot an
OLPC XO into Ubuntu so you can run WeSay in indestructible 5 watt
bliss.&nbsp; Some features are as yet unavailable on Linux, including
audio features, and pdf dictionary making.  Check out the <A HREF="http://projects.palaso.org/wiki/wesay">WeSay
Linux Known Issues</A> wiki for more information.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Peace of Mind</H3>
<P>An important new feature we&rsquo;ve adding in 0.6 is automated
incremental backup.&nbsp; The way this works is that you put some
kind of memory stick into the laptop (like the memory your digital
camera uses), then tell WeSay where to find it.&nbsp; You just leave
that memory chip in, permanently.&nbsp; WeSay will silently keep
changes there, in a way that you can always &ldquo;roll-back&rdquo;
if things go very wrong.&nbsp; This is the first feature that uses
the Chorus collaboration component SIL is building.&nbsp; To enable
this and forthcoming <A HREF="http://projects.palaso.org/chorus">Chorus</A>
features, you need to install a package called &ldquo;Mercurial&rdquo;.
On Windows, download and install <A HREF="http://tortoisehg.sourceforge.net/">TortoiseHG</A>.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">One click to Create PDF Dictionary</H3>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">A PDF dictionary is now a
mouse-click away, once you install <A HREF="http://princexml.com/">princexml</A>.&nbsp;
(This feature is Windows only, temporarily). Please, &gt;let us know
if you use this feature.</SPAN>
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Open With Lexique Pro</H3>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">If you need more some more
than the basics, WeSay now provides a button for opening your
dictionary in <A HREF="http://lexiquepro.com/test.htm">Lexique Pro
(version 3)</A> (Windows only).&nbsp; </SPAN>See <A HREF="http://www.wesay.org/blogs/2009/01/07/single-click-printing/">the
blog</A> for details.
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Audio Recording and Playback</H3>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">You can now add audio
recording and playback to any text field.&nbsp; Simply create a new
writing system, and mark it &ldquo;Audio&rdquo;.&nbsp; Then tick this
writing system for any fields (e.g. Word or Example) where you want
to enable users to speak the text, as well as write it.&nbsp; Audio
files are created in the new &ldquo;audio&rdquo; folder of the WeSay
project.&nbsp; (Temporarily Windows only). See <A HREF="http://www.wesay.org/blogs/2009/01/07/collecting-audio-with-wesay/">the
blog</A> for details.&nbsp; Please, let us know if you use this
feature.</SPAN></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Where was I?</H3>
<P STYLE="text-decoration: none">WeSay now remembers where you were
in the dictionary browse &amp; edit.&nbsp; It also remembers any
adjustments you made to change the size of parts of the screen.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Art of Reading Integration</H3>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none">Now WeSay will use definitions
to search SIL's Art Of Reading clipart library, if you have that CD
in the drive or have copied the contents to C:\ (on windows).&nbsp; A
box opens up with images that might fit the entry.&nbsp; If you
choose one, it is copied to the dictionary project and inserted in
the entry.&nbsp; See <A HREF="http://www.wesay.org/blogs/2009/04/08/art-of-reading-comes-to-wesay/">the
blog</A> for details.</SPAN></P>
<H3 CLASS="western" STYLE="text-decoration: none">Faster</H3>
<P STYLE="text-decoration: none">We're always looking for ways to
make WeSay fast even on small, inexpensive computers.&nbsp; Recent
0.6 builds are our fastest ever.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Save for FieldWorks 5.4</H3>
<P>The LIFT xml format which WeSay uses continues to improve. This
version of WeSay now conforms to version 0.13 of the standard, as
does the forthcoming FLEx 6.0. However, since FLEx 6.0 won't be
publically avialable for several months, this raises the problem for
people wishing to load WeSay data into FieldWorks Language Explorer
5.4. That version of FLEx will tell you that it doesn't know how to
read LIFT version 0.13. We've added a command, found on the toolbar
in the WeSay Configuration Tool, to &quot;Save a copy for FLEx 5.4&quot;.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Easier import from FLEx</H3>
<P>By popular arm-twisting ;-), it is now easier to start a WeSay
project from a FLEx LIFT export. When you run WeSay Configuration
Tool, there is now an option to &quot;Create Project From FLEx LIFT
Export&quot;. WeSay will look through the writing systems in the
LIFT, adding them to the WeSay Configuration, and set the Writing
Systems to show for a few common fields, based on what it finds in
the LIFT file. You will still need to go in an set the fonts, sort
order, and keyboard for Writing Systems. When FieldWorks 6 arrives,
we should be able to import that information as well.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">What Now?</H2>
<P STYLE="text-decoration: none">Get your head around WeSay&hellip;
it&rsquo;s really different.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s aimed at empowering a
very different user than you are, and approaches the task of
dictionary making in a new, super-task-oriented way.&nbsp; Using the
provided samples, play around with both WeSay and the WeSay
Configuration Tool.&nbsp; To do this, go to your Windows Start menu
and find &ldquo;WeSay&rdquo;.&nbsp; Choose one of the icons there
which open the sample project.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Ready to go deeper?</H3>
<P>Consider joining the <A HREF="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/wesay">Google
Group</A>. You can either use this group from your browser, through
your email client, or a mix of both.&nbsp; Until we have real
documentation, this is the place to go when something is unclear.&nbsp;
As you ask questions, we&rsquo;ll answer them there.&nbsp; A Google
Group is a mailing list, but one that you can choose to have sent to
your email box or wait for you to browse on the web, your choice. You
can read old questions and answers.
</P>
<P>Please report a bugs or request a feature using <A HREF="mail://issues@wesay.org">email</A>.
Tell us that you tried it and what you did.&nbsp; No, really.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s human nature to assume someone else had the same crash&hellip;
but if it was easy to run into, we would have found it, and we would
have fixed it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you send to this address, your
issue is automatically entered into our &quot;todo list&quot; and you
will get updates as we work on the problem.</P>
<P>We are adding to WeSay's abilities weekly, and publishing new
versions.&nbsp; Major new features are always announced on <A HREF="http://blogs.wesay.org/">the
blog.</A></P>
