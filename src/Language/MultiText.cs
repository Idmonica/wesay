	/* ----------- ABOUT SUBCLASSES OF MULTITEXT ------------
	* Subclasses of MultiText are used in many (most? all?)
	* fields in WeSay exist to in order to make a
	* signature for fields that we want to search on quickly.
	* This is in influenced by the version of db4o we are using (5.5)
	* as our persistence mechanism, which cannot do fast queries
	* which span collections.
	* For example, consider the following class definition.
	* If we want to load all lexeme-forms into a
	* datastructure for as-you-type approximate matching, we
	* can just pull up all objects of this type from the database.
