wesay (1.5.18) stable; urgency=low

  * WS-96 Restore proper form and guid when recreating deleted word
  * WS-98 Rewrite dialog to display properly on both Windows and Linux
   - 'Create new project from a set of plain LIFT files' dialog
  * When adding a picture, don't change extension of non-png files to png
  * Force a new writing system id when duplicating
   - Duplicating an existing writing system in the UI, then deleting the 
     duplicate would result in deleting the original writing system
     since the duplicate has the same id.

  * WS-92 Prevent message area from being edited by user

wesay (1.5.16) experimental; urgency=low

  * WS-59 Fix Word list not repainting correctly
  * WS-87 Handle pictures imported from Windows on Linux
  * WS-84 Work-around crash caused by loading XulRunner 29 (again)
   - setting MONO_DEBUG=explicit-null-checks keeps mono from crashing
   - this is a temporary work-around until we find the root cause

 -- Chris Hubbard <chris_hubbard@sil.org>  Fri, 27 Jun 2014 15:44:10 -0400

wesay (1.5.15) experimental; urgency=low

  * There are still crashes caused by initialization of XulRunner.
    Added a new environment variable for Linux (WESAY_INIT_XULRUNNER)
    which controls whether XulRunner is initialized on startup.  By
    default, it is initialized.  Turn off XulRunner initialization by
    setting the environment variable to 0.  If WESAY_USE_GECKO=1, then
    XulRunner is still initialized.

 -- Chris Hubbard <chris_hubbard@sil.org>  Wed, 25 Jun 2014 15:17:00 -0400

wesay (1.5.14) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix packaging to actually include
    PalasoUIWindowsForms.GeckoBrowserAdapter.dll
  * WS-84 Fix for crash on exit when using Geckofx-29
   - Code introduced in WeSay with Geckofx-14 which fixed an issue in
     FLEx (FWNX-1216) was causing the crash with Geckofx-29.
   - Re-enable initializing XulRunner on startup (revert change in 1.5.13)

 -- Chris Hubbard <chris_hubbard@sil.org>  Mon, 23 Jun 2014 17:32:08 -0400

wesay (1.5.13) experimental; urgency=low

  * Only initialize XulRunner if using WESAY_USE_GECKO=1 (temporary

    the functionaility of Chorus Notes.

 -- Chris Hubbard <chris_hubbard@sil.org>  Fri, 20 Jun 2014 08:17:06 -0400

wesay (1.5.12) experimental; urgency=low

  * Work-around an exception in chorus syncing which interacts
    with an exception in GeckoFx29 that eventually causes a crash

 -- Chris Hubbard <chris_hubbard@sil.org>  Thu, 19 Jun 2014 08:29:09 -0400

wesay (1.5.11) experimental; urgency=low

  * Skipped 1.5.10 to sync version number with Windows build
  * Fix custom xkb keyboards to be displayed
  * WS-51 Fix text clipping
  * WS-58 Fix GatherWords layout (crashed when resized)
  * Improve Gecko mode
   - Change list box and combo box background color from default to white
   - In DB&E, in Gecko mode, changed the splitter window so that it can't
     stay smaller than width of list box.
   - GeckoFx 29 in Windows doesn't display properly.  Implemented a workaround
     which minimizes and maximizes the window as the last part of setup.
   - Improve list view functionality when the word field is empty and an
     alternate form is used instead.
