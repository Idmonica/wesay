# This git config file lists the build dependencies for building WeSay on Linux.
#
# Possible sections are [common] which apply to all versions of Ubuntu/Debian, distribution
# specific sections, e.g. [Ubuntu] (generated by running lsb_release -i -s), and version
# specific sections, e.g. [precise]. Version specific names are generated by running
# lsb_release -c -s.
# Each section can have up to three variables:
# any - applies to all architectures
# i386 and amd64 - applies only to 32- or 64-bit architecture (output of dpkg --print-architecture)
#
# [common]
# any=build-essential automake uuid-dev
# i386=xvfb

# [precise]
# any=xulrunner-1.9.2
#
# # For quantal use the same packages as for precise
# [quantal]
