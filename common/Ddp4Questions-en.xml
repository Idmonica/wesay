<question>immediate: a meaning label that may be combined with other tense labels to indicate a situation not simultaneous with the moment of speech, but very close to it.</question>
<question>immediate future: what is about to occur.</question>
<question>immediate past: occurring immediately before the moment of speech. Also called the Recent Past. Do not use this label if there is any sense of current relevance--use anterior for that.</question>
<question>Immediate may also be combined with anterior or imperative.</question>
<question>expected future: the situation is to occur in the near future; what is scheduled to happen.</question>
<question>narrative time: the use of a form with no other past uses for reporting a past narrative.</question>

<question>habitual: the situation is customary or usual, repeated on different occasion over a period of time. English 'used to' is past habitual; English 'Nancy sings' is present habitual.</question>
<question>continuous: a single situation is viewed as in progress, as maintained over a period of time; also called "durative." The English "Progressive" is a continuous restricted to dynamic words. English 'I am reading; *I am knowing the number'.</question>
<question>continuative: keep on doing what is being done. Restricted to dynamic words.</question>
<question>progressive: the action takes place simultaneously with the moment of reference, 'to be in the process of...'. This is more restricted than the English Progressive, which may be used for events that are not actually in progress at reference time: 'I am writing a book' may be used even if the speaker is not at that moment writing.</question>
<question>excessive duration: action is extended over a long period of time, longer than normal for that action.</question>
<question>limited duration: action performed for a relatively short or bounded period of time.</question>
<question>iterative: the action is repeated on one occasion; usually restricted to dynamic words, often further restricted to semelfactive words.</question>
<question>frequentative: action occurs frequently, not necessarily habitually, nor necessarily on one occasion, as is the iterative.</question>
<question>imperfective: the situation is viewed as unbounded in the sense that it is habitual, continuous, progressive, or iterative.</question>
<question>perfective: the situation is viewed as bounded temporally. It cannot be simultaneous with the moment of speech; in the non-past it is sometimes interpreted as future.</question>
<question>completive: to do something thoroughly and to completion, e.g. 'to shoot someone dead, to eat up'.</question>
<question>inceptive: the action or event begins. We are distinguishing this from the beginning of a state.</question>
<question>delimited: action is performed only a little.</question>

<question>state exists: the state is begun before reference time and continues after reference time.</question>
<question>state commences: beginning of a state of "becoming." Often called Inceptive or Inchoative.

<question>anterior continuing: past action continues into the present: 'I have waited over an hour' ( = and I'm still waiting).</question>

<question>ability, mental: English: 'Melissa can speak Dutch'.</question>
<question>ability, physical: English: 'Hortense can swim the English Channel'.</question>
<question>attempt: the agent attempts to complete the action specified by the predicate. Note: this has a sense of incompleteness, and I have seen authors call this "Incomplete" and gloss the examples with 'try'.</question>
<question>desire: the agent of the verb desires or wants to complete the action of the verb.</question>
<question>obligation: the agent is obliged to perform the action of the verb.</question>
<question>obligation, strong: it is absolutely incumbent upon the agent to complete the action of the main verb: 'I have to mail this letter today'.</question>
<question>obligation, weak: it is recommended that the agent complete the action of the main verb: 'Harry ought to get a haircut before meeting Sue's mother'.</question>
<question>permission: the agent is allowed to complete the action of the main verb: 'The students may check books out for two weeks'.</question>
<question>root possibility: it is possible for the agent to carry out the action of the main verb; i.e. s/he is able and external conditions allow it: 'You can get that kind of paper at Ulbrich's'.</question>
<question>intention: the agent intends to carry out the action of the main verb: 'Sam's gonna take Sanskrit next semester'.</question>
<question>andative: agent moves away from the deictic center in order to do something, literally 'be going to do something'. Of course such forms are often related to the verb 'to go' and also may have uses of intention and future.</question>
<question>venitive: the agent moves toward the deictic center in order to do something, literally 'be coming to do something'. This may be related to the verb 'to come' and may have future uses as well.</question>

<question>subordinating: Often there are special verb forms or morphemes associated with the verb that occur obligatorily in subordinate clauses of certain types. The extent to which such morphemes can be said to have "meaning" varies, since they often co-occur with other markers of subordination. Their function is primarily to signal the type of subordinate clause.</question>
<question>Complement clauses: A main verb may take as its direct object a clause. These are often referred to as "Noun clauses" or "Noun complements". The verb form of the subordinate clause is usually determined by the semantics of the main verb, so in this case, our meaning labels will just refer to the context. If a verb form occurs in the complements to words of thinking and believing, the meaning label will be complement to words of thinking and believing.</question>

<question>There are a variety of adverbial clauses (other than conditional clauses) that sometimes require a special verb form. The meaning labels for these uses are coded according to the type of clause (purpose, concessive, etc.), whether any particular temporal deixis is part of the meaning, and under "co-occurrence restrictions," whether a particular conjunction is present. The types of clauses we might run into are:</question>
<question>purpose: the clause states the purpose for which the main clause action is taking place. Often called a "final" clause: 'He was saving his money so that his son could go to college'.</question>
<question>concessive: translated in English as 'although, even though, despite the fact that': 'She was saving her money, even though she was a wealthy woman'.</question>

<question>Conditional sentences: Conditional sentences consist of two clauses, the 'if'-clause or protasis (which is a subordinate clause) and the 'then'-clause or apodosis (which is the main clause). Both of these clauses may take special verb forms. (Interestingly enough, they sometime both take the same special verb forms.)</question>
<question>There are at least three types of conditional sentences. (Labels, explanations, and examples from Li and Thompson 1981): [Li, Charles N., and Sandra A. Thompson. 1981. Mandarin Chinese: A functional reference grammar. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press.]</question>
<question>reality condition: a conditional relation between two propositions referring to the so-called real world: 'If you see my sister, you will know that she is pregnant'.</question>
<question>hypothetical: the situation is unreal or imagined, but one that could be true: 'If we moved, we could have a garden'.</question>
<question>counterfactual: the proposition describes an unreal or imagined situation that could have been true but was not: 'If you had taken algebra, you would know this formula' (but you did not).</question>
<question>The verb forms that occur in these sentences will be coded according to the type of sentence, and according to which clause of the sentence they occur in.</question>
<question>Example: the English 'had' + past participle would be coded as:</question>
<question>meaning label:  protasis</question>
<question>meaning label: counterfactual</question>
<question>Since the conjunction 'if' obligatorily occurs in the protasis, there will also be the following:</question>
<question>Co-occurrence restriction: 'if'</question>
<question>This indicates that a morpheme meaning 'if' obligatorily occurs in the protasis. If no such morpheme is necessary, then there will be no co-occurrence restriction.</question>
