	<question>habitual: the situation is customary or usual, repeated on different occasion over a period of time. English 'used to' is past habitual; English 'Nancy sings' is present habitual.</question>
	<question>continuous: a single situation is viewed as in progress, as maintained over a period of time; also called "durative." The English "Progressive" is a continuous restricted to dynamic words. English 'I am reading; *I am knowing the number'.</question>
	<question>continuative: keep on doing what is being done. Restricted to dynamic words.</question>
	<question>progressive: the action takes place simultaneously with the moment of reference, 'to be in the process of...'.

  <semantic-domain guid="IF858278A-2727-4403-9CF0-565CDECECB1E" id="9.6.2.8 Condition">
	<question>Conditional sentences: Conditional sentences consist of two clauses, the 'if'-clause or protasis (which is a subordinate clause) and the 'then'-clause or apodosis (which is the main clause). Both of these clauses may take special verb forms. (Interestingly enough, they sometime both take the same special verb forms.)</question>
	<question>There are at least three types of conditional sentences. (Labels, explanations, and examples from Li and Thompson 1981): [Li, Charles N., and Sandra A. Thompson. 1981. Mandarin Chinese: A functional reference grammar. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press.]</question>
	<question>reality condition: a conditional relation between two propositions referring to the so-called real world: 'If you see my sister, you will know that she is pregnant'.</question>
	<question>hypothetical: the situation is unreal or imagined, but one that could be true: 'If we moved, we could have a garden'.</question>
	<question>counterfactual: the proposition describes an unreal or imagined situation that could have been true but was not: 'If you had taken algebra, you would know this formula' (but you did not).</question>
	<question>The verb forms that occur in these sentences will be coded according to the type of sentence, and according to which clause of the sentence they occur in.</question>
	<question>Example: the English 'had' + past participle would be coded as:</question>
	<question>meaning label: protasis</question>
	<question>meaning label: counterfactual</question>
	<question>Since the conjunction 'if' obligatorily occurs in the protasis, there will also be the following:</question>
	<question>Co-occurrence restriction: 'if'</question>
	<question>This indicates that a morpheme meaning 'if' obligatorily occurs in the protasis. If no such morpheme is necessary, then there will be no co-occurrence restriction.</question>
