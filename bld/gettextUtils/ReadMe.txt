To Update Po Files, you'll need one of the Gnu Gettext utilities, msgmerge.  Note, some versions for win32 on the net are way out of date and won't work.  I used this version: http://sourceforge.net/projects/gettext.

These are not included in our source tree because, along with the lib files, it comes to 1.6 Megs.
